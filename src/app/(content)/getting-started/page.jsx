        <h2>Why Java?</h2>
        <p>
          Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in academic,
          enterprise, and systems development. Its strong object-oriented
          foundation, platform independence, and rich standard library make it
          an ideal language for understanding core programming principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          For engineering students, Java serves as a bridge between theoretical
          concepts and real-world software development, encouraging disciplined
          coding practices and design-oriented thinking.
